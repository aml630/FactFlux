# Description

I created FactFlux to be a tool for people to use to help track current events in their context through time
across a wide range of different news sources. 

It uses RSS and YouTube feeds to consistantly check for new content, and place that content on an easy 
to read timeline.  Users of FactFlux can easily see which words and phrases are being used most actively
across a range of media outlets.  From there they can drill down to see what the discussion around this topic
has looked like in the past.
